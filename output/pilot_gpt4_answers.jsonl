{"Question": "Im confused what creatinine?", "Free_form_answer": "The body produces creatinine as a byproduct of muscle cells breaking down creatine phosphate for energy. The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine. Creatinine levels that are high in the blood and low in urine may indicate kidney problems. Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function. Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected. It's worth noting that intense exercise and some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels.\n\n", "Must_have": ["Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle cells breaking down creatine phosphate for energy", "The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine", "High creatinine levels in the blood and low levels in urine may indicate kidney problems", "Intense exercise can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels", "Some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine level"], "Nice_to_have": ["Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected", " Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function"], "id": 89, "answer": "Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Creatine is used by muscles for energy. The kidneys filter creatinine from the blood and excrete it in urine. The level of creatinine in your blood and its clearance rate in urine are important indicators of kidney function. High blood levels of creatinine can be a sign of kidney damage or impaired kidney function."}

{"Question": "Is there anything you can prescribe for anal fissure", "Free_form_answer": "The treatment goal for anal fissures is to relieve pain, relax the internal anal sphincter and prevent injury by large or hard bowel movements. For typical anal fissures, initial management consists of supportive measures and a topical vasodilator for at least one month. Warm sitz baths after bowel movements can give temporary symptomatic relief. Stool softeners and laxatives can treat constipation, whilst increasing dietary fiber or fiber supplements can prevent hard bowel movements.

{"Question": "Is there a reason why my urine is clear", "Free_form_answer": "Normally, urine should be clear and have a slight yellow hue. The shade of yellow may vary depending on whether the urine is more diluted or concentrated. If urine appears to be colorless, it most commonly indicates that someone has been drinking too much water. However, colorless urine can also be a symptom of other health issues like diabetes, kidney problems, diabetes insipidus, certain medications like diuretics, or pregnancy. While it's normal to occasionally experience colorless urine, it's important to seek medical attention if this occurs consistently for more than two days while also experiencing increased urination, as it could signify electrolyte loss.
