{"Question": "Im confused what creatinine?", "Free_form_answer": "The body produces creatinine as a byproduct of muscle cells breaking down creatine phosphate for energy. The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine. Creatinine levels that are high in the blood and low in urine may indicate kidney problems. Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function. Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected. It's worth noting that intense exercise and some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels.\n\n", "Must_have": ["Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle cells breaking down creatine phosphate for energy", "The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine", "High creatinine levels in the blood and low levels in urine may indicate kidney problems", "Intense exercise can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels", "Some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine level"], "Nice_to_have": ["Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected", " Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function"], "id": 89, "answer": "Creatinine is a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body, and the level of creatinine in your blood is an indicator of kidney function. When your kidneys are working properly, they filter out creatinine from your blood, and it is excreted in your urine. However, if your kidneys are not functioning correctly, the level of creatinine in your blood can increase.\n\nThe serum creatinine test is a common blood test used to evaluate kidney function. It measures the level of creatinine in your blood. A high creatinine level may indicate that your kidneys are not working as well as they should be, which can be a sign of kidney disease or damage.\n\nIn general, a normal creatinine level ranges from 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL for adult females, but these values can vary slightly depending on the laboratory and the individual's muscle mass."}
{"Question": "Could esophagitis could like muscle stiffness in the neck when swallowing?", "Free_form_answer": "Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus caused by various factors including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), infections, or medications.

While it primarily affects the esophagus, the pain and discomfort can sometimes radiate to nearby areas, including the neck. Muscle stiffness in the neck when swallowing is not a typical symptom of esophagitis, but it is possible for people with esophagitis to experience referred pain or discomfort in the neck area due to the shared nerve pathways between the esophagus and the neck. However, this symptom is more commonly associated with other conditions such as cervical spine disorders, muscle strain, or even conditions like Eagle syndrome, which involves the stylohyoid ligament. If you are experiencing persistent or severe neck stiffness when swallowing, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis."}

{"Question": "Is Augmentin the same thing as Amoxcicilin?", "Free_form_answer": "Augmentin is an antibacterial medication which is consisted of two active drugs: amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic from the penicillin family, which is used against certain bacterial infections. Some bacteria developed mechanisms of resistance to amoxicillin effect.

It can detect abnormalities such as:\n\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\n- Protein in the urine (proteinuria)\n- Glucose in the urine (glycosuria)\n- Ketones in the urine (ketonuria)\n- pH imbalance\n- Concentration abnormalities\n\nOn the other hand, a urine culture is a test specifically designed to detect and identify microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or yeast, that may be present in the urine. This test is typically used to diagnose urinary tract infections (UTIs). A urine culture involves placing a urine sample in a special medium that allows bacteria to grow, and then identifying the type and quantity of microorganisms present.\n\nWhile a urinalysis can provide clues about a possible UTI, such as the presence of white blood cells or blood, a urine culture is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific microorganism responsible for the infection. This information is essential to guide antibiotic treatment and ensure effective management of the infection."}
{"Question": "My cat was just diagnosed with a tapeworm, could that be something I can get from him?", "Free_form_answer": "It is possible to contract a tapeworm from an infected cat, although it is not common. There are two types of tapeworms that can infect cats. The most prevalent type is Dipylidium caninum, which does not directly infect humans. Ingesting a flea that is infected with the tapeworm is the only way humans can contract it, and it usually happens through close contact between children and their infected pets. The second type of tapeworm is Echinococcus multilocularis, which is less common in cats. This tapeworm can be transmitted to humans by ingesting feces from an infected animal. To reduce the risk of contracting these tapeworms, it is essential to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after handling your cat and its feces. If you suspect that you have contracted tapeworms, it is advisable to consult your veterinarian to determine the type of tapeworm and seek medical attention from a healthcare provider.", "Must_have": ["Washing hands thoroughly with soap after touching a cat and its feces can reduce the risk of contracting tapeworms.", " It is possible to get infected with a tapeworm from an infected cat, although it's not common.", " It is advisable to see a health care provider for diagnosis and treatment if one thinks they might have gotten infected with tapeworms."], "Nice_to_have": ["Infection with Dipylidium caninum occurs most commonly by close contact between children and their infected pets.", " Dipylidium caninum is the most common type of tapeworm that infects cats and is not directly contagious for humans.", " It is advisable to consult with a veterinarian about the type of diagnosed tapeworm in a cat.", " Humans can get infected with Dipylidium caninum by ingesting a flea infected with the tapeworm.", " Echinococcus multilocularis is a less common type of tapeworm in cats that can be contagious for humans by ingestion of the infected animal's feces."], "id": 130, "answer": "Yes, it is possible for humans to get tapeworms from their infected cats, but the risk is relatively low if proper precautions are taken. The most common tapeworm found in cats is the flea tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum), which is usually transmitted through the ingestion of infected fleas. \n\nIn rare cases, humans, especially children, can become infected with the flea tapeworm if they accidentally ingest an infected flea while petting their cat or touching contaminated feces. However, this requires the ingestion of the flea itself, not just the tapeworm eggs or segments that may be present in the cat's feces.\n\nAnother type of tapeworm, the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium), can also infect cats, but this is less common. This tapeworm can be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of undercooked or raw pork containing the tapeworm cysts, not directly from an infected cat.\n\nTo minimize the risk of transmission, it's essential to maintain good hygiene practices, such as washing your hands thoroughly after handling your cat or its feces, and ensuring that your cat receives regular flea control and deworming treatments as prescribed by your veterinarian."}
