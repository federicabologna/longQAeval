During a cluster period, the headaches often occur once or more daily, at the same times each day. The exact cause of cluster headaches isn't known, but they are believed to involve a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Risk factors may include a family history of cluster headaches and smoking. Unlike migraines, cluster headaches are not typically associated with triggers such as foods, hormonal changes, or stress. Treatments for cluster headaches are usually specific and include oxygen therapy, triptans, and sometimes preventive medications like verapamil or steroids. It is important for individuals experiencing these types of headaches to seek medical consultation for proper diagnosis and management.", "answer_type": "gpt4", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "Yes", "batch_id": "batch_9", "confidence": "Fairly confident", "correctness": "Partially Agree", "relevance": "Partially Agree", "safety": "Partially Agree", "time": 95.1137216091156}

Also, avoid exposure to irritants like tobacco smoke, pollution, and strong chemicals.\n4. **Elevate your head**: When sleeping, elevate your head using extra pillows to help reduce congestion and prevent mucus from dripping down the back of your throat.\n5. **Manage underlying conditions**: If you have conditions like sinusitis, rhinitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), managing these conditions through medical treatment can help reduce postnasal drip.\n6. **Saline nasal sprays**: Using saline nasal sprays can help moisturize your nasal passages and loosen mucus, making it easier to expel.", "answer_type": "llama", "annotation_type": "coarse", "rated": "Yes", "batch_id": "batch_3", "confidence": "Fairly confident", "correctness": "Neutral", "relevance": "Partially Agree", "safety": "Partially Disagree", "time": 48.61113405227661}

Pancreatic cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, can cause an increase in lipase levels due to the tumor's effect on the surrounding pancreatic tissue.\n\nLow lipase levels, on the other hand, are more commonly associated with conditions that affect the pancreas's ability to produce digestive enzymes, such as:\n\n1. Chronic pancreatitis: This condition causes inflammation and scarring of the pancreas, leading to a decrease in lipase production.\n2. Cystic fibrosis: This genetic disorder affects the pancreas and other organs, leading to a deficiency in digestive enzymes, including lipase.\n3. Pancreatic insufficiency: This condition can result from various causes, including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or surgical removal of the pancreas, leading to a decrease in lipase production.\n\nIt's crucial to note that a single low lipase level is not diagnostic of any condition.
