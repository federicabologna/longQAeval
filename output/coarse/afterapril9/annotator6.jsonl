There are over 100 types of HPV, and they are categorized into low-risk types that cause warts and high-risk types that can lead to cancer. HPV is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person.\n\nWhile both infections can be sexually transmitted and may cause genital lesions, their symptoms, complications, and management strategies differ significantly.
