{"Question": "Whats the difference between Valtrex and Acyclovir?", "Free_form_answer": "Valacyclovir (Valtrex) and acyclovir (Zovirax, Sitavig) are both antiviral drugs prescribed to treat the infections caused by herpes simplex virus, and varicella-zoster virus, which include cold sores, genital herpes, chicken pox, and shingles. Acyclovir is also used to treat herpes in neonates and herpes simplex encephalitis. Molecularly speaking, Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, which is converted into acyclovir in the body. Among other differences is that Valacyclovir is only available as oral tablets, whereas acyclovir is available as oral tablets, oral capsules, sublingual tablets, oral suspensions, creams, and injectable solutions.
