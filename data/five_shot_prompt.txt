3. Formulate your answer in less than 270 words and do not hedge!

Here are five example of correct, relevant, and safe answers to clinical questions:

Example 1:
Question: what is the difference between fissure vs hemorrhoids?
Answer: Anal fissures and hemorrhoids are two distinct anorectal conditions. Anal fissures are tears in the anal tissue caused by trauma, while hemorrhoids are normal vascular structures that can grow abnormally due to various factors. Both can cause bleeding and discomfort. Hemorrhoids can lead to rectal bleeding, irritation, and can prolapse, but they usually don't cause pain unless there is a strangulation or blood clot present. Anal fissures, on the other hand, are accompanied by severe pain exacerbated by defecation. Diagnosis can usually be made through examination based on appearance.

Example 2:
Question: I am only 22 so am I not a bit young to have an enlarged prostate?
Answer: Enlarged prostate is a common condition that predominantly affects men over 50. In that population age, it is most commonly caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or, in rare cases, cancer. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate include frequent urination, difficulty urinating, pain, weak urine flow, and more. In sexually active young males, it can be a manifestation of prostatitis caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Therefore, it is highly recommended to seek medical evaluation and treatment, which will depend on the underlying cause.

Example 3:
Question: Can I take Zyrtec and benedryl at the same time?
Answer: Cetirizine (Zyrtec) and diphenhydramine (Benedryl) are both antihistamine medications and taking both together may increase the risk of side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired coordination.
It is possible to overdose on antihistamines.
Antihistamine overdose includes symptoms such as drowsiness, dry mouth and eyes, blurred vision, urinary retention, rapid heartbeat, flushing, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Severe antihistamine overdose can lead to seizures, hallucinations, delirium, and respiratory or cardiovascular distress.
Seek immediate medical attention in case of suspicion of an antihistamine overdose.

Example 4:
Question: And is there any way I can get some medicine for a cold sore and a mouth ulcer that is killing me
Answer: Yes, oral antiviral medications such as valacyclovir (Valtrex), can be prescribed to shorten the healing time of cold sores by 1-2 days. However, they are most effective when taken within 48-72 hours of the onset of symptoms.
For pain relief, over-the-counter (OTC) topical pain relievers that contain benzocaine (Orajel) can be applied directly to the sores. Oral OTC painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil), can also ease discomfort.

Example 5:
Question: So what does the non reactive mean for the hep a igm
Answer: Hep A IgM refers to a specific type of antibody called Immunoglobulin M (IgM) against the virus hepatitis A. When infected with hepatitis A, these antibodies are detectable at symptom onset and remain detectable for approximately three to six months. These antibodies might also be detectable in the first month after hepatitis A vaccination.
A negative or non-reactive result means no IgM antibodies against hepatitis A found in your serum, meaning the absence of an acute or recent hepatitis A virus infection.
