{"Question": "Im confused what creatinine?", "Free_form_answer": "The body produces creatinine as a byproduct of muscle cells breaking down creatine phosphate for energy. The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine. Creatinine levels that are high in the blood and low in urine may indicate kidney problems. Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function. Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected. It's worth noting that intense exercise and some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels.\n\n", "Must_have": ["Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle cells breaking down creatine phosphate for energy", "The kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood and eliminate it through urine", "High creatinine levels in the blood and low levels in urine may indicate kidney problems", "Intense exercise can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine levels", "Some medications can lead to temporarily elevated serum creatinine level"], "Nice_to_have": ["Healthcare providers may request creatinine testing as part of a regular check-up or if kidney disease is suspected", " Doctors can use creatinine levels, along with patient age, gender, and race, to calculate eGFR, which helps assess kidney function"], "id": 89}

{"Question": "Is there a reason why my urine is clear", "Free_form_answer": "Normally, urine should be clear and have a slight yellow hue. The shade of yellow may vary depending on whether the urine is more diluted or concentrated.
