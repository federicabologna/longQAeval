There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon, and it's not always a straightforward answer.\\n\\nIn some cases, shoulder pain can be referred pain from a lung condition, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, or a pulmonary embolism. This type of pain is usually sharp and stabbing, and it can worsen with deep breathing or movement.\\n\\nAnother possible explanation is that the shoulder pain is related to a musculoskeletal issue, such as a strain or sprain of the shoulder muscles or tendons. Breathing can cause movement in the shoulder joint, which can irritate the affected tissues and worsen the pain.\\n\\nAdditionally, some conditions like costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone) or Tietze's syndrome (inflammation of the muscles and cartilage in the chest wall) can cause shoulder pain that worsens with breathing.\\n\\nIt's also possible that the shoulder pain is related to a gastrointestinal issue, such as gallbladder disease or pancreatitis, which can radiate pain to the shoulder and worsen with breathing.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of this symptom, it's highly recommended to seek medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your shoulder pain. A thorough examination, imaging studies, and diagnostic tests can help identify the root cause and guide treatment.\"}\n",

It is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes, which include Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. These fungi thrive in warm, moist environments and can infect humans through direct contact with an infected person, animal, or contaminated object.\\n\\nRingworm can also be spread through indirect contact, such as walking barefoot in areas where the fungus is present, or by sharing personal care items like towels or clothing. In some cases, ringworm can be contracted from infected animals, such as cats or dogs.\\n\\nThe most common causes of ringworm include:\\n\\n* Direct contact with an infected person or animal\\n* Indirect contact with contaminated objects or surfaces\\n* Sharing personal care items\\n* Walking barefoot in areas where the fungus is present\\n* Poor hygiene and skin care\\n\\nSymptoms of ringworm typically appear within 4-10 days of exposure and can include a circular, itchy rash, redness, and scaling. Treatment for ringworm usually involves antifungal medications, either topical or oral, and good hygiene practices to prevent further spread of the infection.'}\n",

      "{'Question': 'Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ?', 'Free_form_answer': 'Lutein is a carotenoid compound which is available in green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, and peas), along with other foods, such as eggs, pistachios, and corn. Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, which is the light sensitive area of the eye. Studies have attributed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects to lutein. The studies suggest that lutein may protect against and reduce the severity of many eye diseases. By reducing damage to the retina, lutein may enhance vision in both normal and diseased eyes.\\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is also found in the retina. DHA is involved in the process of transforming light to a neurological signal and generating light sensitive pigment. Studies on the effects of DHA (omega 3) found mixed results on improvement of vision, but no studies showed a negative effect. There is no medical recommendation for omega 3 consumption in eye diseases or to improve vision.', 'Must_have': ['Lutein may protect against and reduce severity the of many eye diseases.', 'Lutein reduces damage to the retina, which enhances vision in both normal and diseased eyes.', 'Studies on the effects of DHA (omega 3) found mixed results on improvement of vision.', ' There is no medical recommendation for omega 3 consumption in eye diseases or to improve vision.', 'Lutein is found to have a positive effect on vision.'], 'Nice_to_have': ['DHA is also found in the retina, and is needed for the process of transforming light to a neurological signal, and for generating light sensitive pigment.', 'Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, the light sensitive area of the eye.', 'Omega 3 has mixed results regarding positive effects on vision but no negative effects were found.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found naturally in fish.', 'Lutein is a carotenoid compound found in green leafy vegetables, eggs, pistachios, and corn.', 'Studies have reported anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects attributed to lutein concentration.'], 'id': 11, 'answer': \"Yes, lutein and omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for vision health.\\n\\nLutein is a carotenoid that acts as an antioxidant, protecting the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision, from damage caused by blue light and free radicals. High levels of lutein in the macula are associated with a reduced risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. Foods rich in lutein include leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, and supplements are also available.\\n\\nOmega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), play a crucial role in the structure and function of the retina. They help maintain the integrity of the retinal cells and support the visual processing system. Omega-3 deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of AMD, dry eye syndrome, and other eye problems. Fatty fish, such as salmon and sardines, are rich in omega-3s, and supplements are also available.\\n\\nWhile lutein and omega-3s are beneficial for vision, it's essential to note that they may not improve existing vision problems but rather help prevent or slow the progression of age-related eye diseases. A balanced diet and regular eye exams are still essential for maintaining healthy vision.\"}\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Patient**: The patient should relax, sitting comfortably with their back supported, legs uncrossed, and not having smoked, exercised, or consumed caffeine within 30 minutes prior to measurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Position the Arm**: Arm should be supported on a flat surface at heart level. The upper arm should be bare, with clothing removed or sleeves raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Place the Cuff**: Wrap the cuff around the upper arm, making sure it’s snug but not too tight. The lower edge of the cuff should be about an inch above the bend of the elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Position the Stethoscope**: Place the stethoscope’s earpieces in your ears and the diaphragm on the inside of the elbow crease directly over the brachial artery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Inflate the Cuff**: Inflate the cuff by pumping the bulb until the gauge reads about 20-30 mmHg above usual systolic pressure (if unknown, inflate to 180 mmHg). The cuff should compress the arm enough so no pulse is felt at the wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Measure the Pressure**: Slowly deflate the cuff by opening the valve and listen through the stethoscope. The first knocking sound (systolic pressure) is noted. Continue to let air out slowly; \n",

These medications are often prescribed for conditions such as gastroenteritis, motion sickness, and chemotherapy-induced nausea. Some common anti-nausea medications include:\n",

      "1. Ondansetron (Zofran): This medication is often prescribed for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.\n",
      "2. Metoclopramide (Reglan): This medication is often used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by gastroenteritis, migraines, and other conditions.\n",
      "3. Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine): This medication is often used to treat motion sickness and can also be used to alleviate nausea and vomiting caused by other conditions.\n",
      "4. Prochlorperazine (Compazine): This medication is often used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by gastroenteritis, migraines, and other conditions.\n",

      "It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any anti-nausea medication, as they can recommend the best medication and dosage for your specific condition. Additionally, it's crucial to follow the recommended dosage and administration instructions carefully to ensure the medication is effective and safe.\n",
