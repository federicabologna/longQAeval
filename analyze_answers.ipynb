      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Patient**: The patient should relax, sitting comfortably with their back supported, legs uncrossed, and not having smoked, exercised, or consumed caffeine within 30 minutes prior to measurement.\n",

      "2. **Position the Arm**: Arm should be supported on a flat surface at heart level. The upper arm should be bare, with clothing removed or sleeves raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Place the Cuff**: Wrap the cuff around the upper arm, making sure it’s snug but not too tight. The lower edge of the cuff should be about an inch above the bend of the elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Position the Stethoscope**: Place the stethoscope’s earpieces in your ears and the diaphragm on the inside of the elbow crease directly over the brachial artery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Inflate the Cuff**: Inflate the cuff by pumping the bulb until the gauge reads about 20-30 mmHg above usual systolic pressure (if unknown, inflate to 180 mmHg). The cuff should compress the arm enough so no pulse is felt at the wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Measure the Pressure**: Slowly deflate the cuff by opening the valve and listen through the stethoscope. The first knocking sound (systolic pressure) is noted. Continue to let air out slowly; \n",

      "1. Ondansetron (Zofran): This medication is often prescribed for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.\n",
      "2. Metoclopramide (Reglan): This medication is often used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by gastroenteritis, migraines, and other conditions.\n",
      "3. Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine): This medication is often used to treat motion sickness and can also be used to alleviate nausea and vomiting caused by other conditions.\n",
